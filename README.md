# ai shakespeare generator
## What is the point of this project?
This project is a quite simple AI shakespeare 5 sentance generator that uses Shakespeares writing style!
## Can you give me an example paragraph?
For sure, take a look below!
```
Then can I then be elder than thou art, why should I do but tend, Upon the hours, and times of your memory. Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou make the earth devour her own sweet skill. Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, And make me tongue-tied speaking of your memory. And every humour hath his windows glazed with thine eyes: Now see what good turns now unto the other, When that churl death my days should expiate. Sweet love renew thy force, be it ten for one, Ten times thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: Thou that art now the world's due, by the height of happier men.
```
## How does it work?
Very common method, I train a markovify text model with <a>https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt</a>. In the link is hundreds upon hundreds of Shakespeares work throughout his lifetime, the model is trained by it, learns it, and then generates text with that logic.
## Can I use this work?
Of course, feel free to change, analyze, improve, and whatever else you might want to do!
